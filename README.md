Scenario 1: 

Random dispersion of the agents of two social groups. 

The first group has a high solidarity rate (low affinity) and the second - a high affinity rate (low solidarity).

Both groups consist of the same number of agents.

Scenario 2:

The first group has a high solidarity rate (low affinity) and the second - a high affinity rate (low solidarity).

Both groups consist of the same number of agents.
However, the dispersion of agents is not random - they present two separate areas.

Scenario 3:

The first group has a high solidarity rate (low affinity) and the second - a high affinity rate (low solidarity).

There are fewer agents in the group with higher affinity rate, but they present isolated aggregation inside the second social group.
